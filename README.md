In this project, you will create a simpler version of a banking system.
You’ll design the banking system using Python OOP techniques. In your bank model, you’ll
want to have entities for customers, accounts, employees, and services like loans and
credit cards. Each of these entities will have distinct properties and you’ll need to decide
what the relevant properties are for each entity.
Customer records could have a customer’s first name, last name, and address, while
accounts could have account_type (checking/savings), deposit, withdrawal, and balance.
You’ll also need to create getter and setter methods when necessary.
